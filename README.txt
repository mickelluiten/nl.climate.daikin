This app requires that your Daikin air conditioner is equipped with a WiFi adapter (either model BRP069A-- or BRP069B--). This app does NOT support "Sky Air" ducted/ceiling models, models that are/can only be controlled by Daikin’s Residential Controller app (which was introduced in January of 2021) and/or models equipped with a BRP069C– WiFi adapter.

<<Features>>
- supports most Daikin airconditioners that belonging to Daikin's "Air-to-air heat pumps" group of products through a single driver.

- the user interface shows target temperature, operating mode, inside temperature, outside temperature, fan speed and fan swing mode.

- HomeKit support (see note) for every WiFi capable Daikin Airconditioner thru the "Air-to-air Heatpump (HomeKit)". The AC control functionality is however limited to: airco's mode setting, target temperature setting and inside temperature measurement.

Note: requires either Homey's experimental Apple Homekit feature enabled or one of the following apps: "HomeKit by Sprut", "HomeyKit by Bas Jansen".

- special modes, i.e. POWERFUL, are supported for some models/model variants although still experimental.

Note: having these functions on you airco's IR remote control does not mean that these special modes can be controlled via WiFi.
