Turn your airconditioner on and off, select the target indoor temperature, adjust fan speed, swing mode and much more. With Daikin AI you create the perfect indoor climate in every room, right for the season and time of day.
Visit the community forum (the link can be found at the bottom of this page) for the app's user manual and/or support.

This app requires that your Daikin air conditioner is equipped with a WiFi adapter (either model BRP069A-- or BRP069B--). This app does NOT support “Sky Air” ducted/ceiling models, models that are/can only be controlled by Daikin’s Residential Controller app (which was introduced in January of 2021) and/or models equipped with a C type (i.e. BRP069C4x) WiFi adapter.
